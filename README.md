# RobotOS
how did you get here?
This is a useless respository for a weird operating sysytem/UI thing for the open computers mod for minecraft.
It doesn't really do anything interesting. It uses a ported version of the GUI library from MineOS.
this repository is just to store files for the installer to download/
the OS itself is more of like how Windows 98 was more of a UI for DOS, this is basically a UI for OpenOS.

you can leave now.
